In the above example, stud is an instance of the Student entity graph which includes references of StudentAddress and StudentCourse entities. context.Attach(stud).State = EntityState.Added attaches the stud entity graph to a context and sets Added state to it.

The Attach() method sets Added EntityState to the root entity (in this case Student) irrespective of whether it contains the Key value or not. If a child entity contains the key value, then it will be marked as Unchanged, otherwise it will be marked as Added. The output of the above example shows that the Student entity has Added EntityState, the child entities with non-empty key values have Unchanged EntityState and the ones with empty key values have Added state.

The following table lists the behaviour of the Attach() method when setting a different EntityState to a disconnected entity graph.


Attach()	Root entity with Key value	Root Entity with Empty or CLR default value	Child Entity with Key value	Child Entity with empty or CLR default value
context.Attach(entityGraph).State = EntityState.Added	Added	Added	Unchanged	Added
context.Attach(entityGraph).State = EntityState.Modified	Modified	Exception	Unchanged	Added
context.Attach(entityGraph).State = EntityState.Deleted	Deleted	Exception	Unchanged	Added
