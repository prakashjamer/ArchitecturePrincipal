Entity Framework Core provides the DbSet.FromSql() method to execute raw SQL queries for the underlying database and get the results as entity objects.

The following example demonstrates executing a raw SQL query to MS SQL Server database.

var context = new SchoolContext();

var students = context.Students
                  .FromSql("Select * from Students where Name = 'Bill'")
                  .ToList();


In the above example, the FromSql() method is used after the Students entity set (DbSet<Student>), 
so the specified SQL query must return records from the Students table which will transform 
in Student entities. Entity Framework Core will execute the specified query to the database 
i.e. Select * from Students where Name = 'Bill' in the above example.


string name = "Bill";

var context = new SchoolContext();
var students = context.Students
                    .FromSql($"Select * from Students where Name = '{name}'")
                    .ToList();

string name = "Bill";

var context = new SchoolContext();
var students = context.Students
                    .FromSql("Select * from Students where Name = '{0}'", name)
                    .OrderBy(s => s.StudentId)
                    .ToList();
